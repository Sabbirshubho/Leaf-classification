# Leaf-Classification

Machine Learning model with simple logistic regression to classify leaves.

There are estimated to be nearly half a million species of plant in the world. Classification of species has been historically problematic and often results in duplicate identifications. Automating plant recognition might have many applications, including:

Species population tracking and preservation
Plant-based medicinal research
Crop and food supply management

This dataset originates from leaf images collected by  
James Cope, Thibaut Beghin, Paolo Remagnino, & Sarah Barman of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, UK.

I thank the UCI machine learning repository for hosting the dataset.
